Description
-----------

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Players can only slide the tiles in four directions (up, down, left, or right), and with each move, a new tile with the value of 2 or 4 is randomly generated on the grid. The game ends when there are no more possible moves or when a tile with the value of 2048 is created.

--------

The 2048 game offers the following features:

-   **Simple Gameplay**: The game has easy-to-understand rules, making it accessible to players of all ages.
-   **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive and can be played on different devices and screen sizes.
-   **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, allowing them to track their progress and aim for higher scores.
-   **Undo Move**: Players have the option to undo their previous move, giving them the ability to rethink their strategy.
-   **Game Over Detection**: The game detects when there are no more possible moves and displays a "Game Over" message.
-   **Best Score**: The game saves the player's best score, encouraging them to beat their previous records.

Usage
-----

Once the game is launched, you can start playing by using the arrow keys on your keyboard to slide the tiles in the desired direction (up, down, left, or right). The goal is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the value of 2048. As you make moves, new tiles with the value of 2 or 4 will appear on the grid. Keep combining and strategizing to achieve the highest score possible.

If you make a mistake or want to try a different strategy, you can use the "Undo" button to revert to your previous move. The game will automatically detect when there are no more possible moves, and it will display a "Game Over" message.

Challenge yourself to beat your best score and achieve the highest tile value!
